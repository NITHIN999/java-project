## Student - Diary

The title of this project is "Student Diary"

I made this project this project as a part of my Object Oriented Programming with Java course in my Semester 3.

This project is a Java application which is similar to that of the AUMS - Amrita Unviversity Management System (but of a smaller version, only for Students.)

### Description

This application not only deals with the marks and grades but also have some extra features like records containing the Students's extra curricular activities like student clubs and sports.

I created this application using Eclipse.

I want to add some GUI to this application (may be after my semester).
